## About

A static HTML/XML and CSS generator from Nim code. For cats (humans are tolerated).

This is the successor to [my other/old HTML/XML/CSS generator **websitegenerator**](https://github.com/nirokay/websitegenerator/)
rewritten (more like reimplemented with major changes, so like, idk how you would call that... remade?) and enhanced.

## Roadmap

### Planned features

* [x] HTML/XML Generation
* [x] CSS Generation
* [x] HTML/XML sugar syntax
* [x] CSS sugar syntax
* [x] HTML QoL tag constants (`p`, `input`, `br`, ...)
* [ ] CSS QoL property and property value constants (`text-align`, `color`, ... ; `center`, `Red`, ...)
* [ ] HTML QoL procs (`p("text")` for `newHtmlElement("p", "text")`)
* [ ] CSS QoL procs
* [ ] DOM procs
* [ ] `HtmlElement.style` field stuff (usage similar to typescript element style manipulation)

### Distant future ideas

* [ ] HTML/XML Parsing
* [ ] CSS Parsing
