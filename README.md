## About

A static HTML/XML and CSS generator from Nim code. For cats (humans are tolerated).

This is the successor to [my other/old HTML/XML/CSS generator **websitegenerator**](https://github.com/nirokay/websitegenerator/)
rewritten (more like reimplemented with major changes, so like, idk how you would call that... remade?) and enhanced.

## Roadmap

### Planned features

[x] HTML/XML Generation
[ ] CSS Generation
[ ] Sugar syntax
[ ] HTML QoL procs (`p("text")` for `newHtmlElement("p", "text")`)
[ ] CSS QoL procs
[ ] DOM procs
[ ] `HtmlElement.style` field stuff (usage similar to typescript element style manipulation)

### Distant future ideas

[ ] HTML/XML Parsing
[ ] CSS Parsing
